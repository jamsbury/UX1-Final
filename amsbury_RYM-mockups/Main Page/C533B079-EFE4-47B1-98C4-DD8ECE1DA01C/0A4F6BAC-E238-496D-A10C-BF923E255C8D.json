    "string": "Brother’s Keeper is one poorer cuts on the track listing, with a larger than life soul arrangement similar to Isaac Hayes oddly paired with some 808 hi-hats and a Pusha T feature which would of far better fit on a track like Mansa Musa, which presents another unusual problem the record encounters numerous times – oddly placed features. This is not to say all features don’t land, Snoop Dogg on Anywhere for example is one of the better placed features, but Kendrick Lamar on Tints is such a missed opportunity when placing his presence on a track like Trippy would have been a far better marriage. Q-Tip’s feature on Cheers sounds misplaced and duct-taped onto the track, being presented in an almost cheesy late 2000s top 40 sounding song breakdown, which jars against the hard-hitting funky beat and Paak’s tight flows on the rest of the song. \nOxnar is served as an homage and love-letter to African American music as it is littered with nods and homages to Paak’s predecessors. However, instead of choosing to cherry pick the best and leave some of the less savoury traditions behind, Paak picks some of the less tasteful ones, for example ending Headlow’s with a shameless sexual interlude, similar to what the The Notorious B.I.G. or Ol' Dirty Bastard did in the 90s. The most detrimental ‘cultural’ adoption is the blatant presence a lot of strongly sexist and misogynistic lyrical tendencies peppered throughout the album (especially on Sweet Chick which presents an awfully dated and sexist ‘crazy ex-girlfriend’ narrative) which makes it more blatant and conflicting when paired next to the progressive, contemporary and conscious ‘protest’ orientated tracks. I love Anderson Paak for his musicianship, love and appreciation on this record, but it’s a shame that the record didn’t fulfil its complete potential, which I believe lands a lot higher than where it’s at."
